### Dataset Used

The project utilizes the TLC Trip Record Data, which includes extensive details about taxi trips conducted by yellow and green taxis in New York City. This rich dataset provides insights into taxi operations, passenger behavior, and fare dynamics. Key attributes include:

- **VendorID:** Identifies the provider (e.g., Creative Mobile Technologies, VeriFone Inc.).
- **tpep_pickup_datetime and tpep_dropoff_datetime:** Capture the start and end times of each trip.
- **Passenger_count:** Number of passengers per trip, as reported by the driver.
- **Trip_distance:** Distance traveled during the trip, measured in miles.
- **PULocationID and DOLocationID:** TLC Taxi Zones for pick-up and drop-off locations.
- **RateCodeID:** Type of rate applied to the trip (e.g., Standard, JFK, Newark).
- **Store_and_fwd_flag:** Indicates if the trip data was stored locally before being sent to the server due to lack of a direct connection.
- **Payment_type:** Method of payment (e.g., Credit card, Cash).
- **Fare_amount, Extra, MTA_tax, Improvement_surcharge, Tip_amount, Tolls_amount, Total_amount:** Various components of the fare.
- **Congestion_Surcharge:** Additional charge collected for rides passing through congested areas.
- **Airport_fee:** Fee applied to trips picked up at LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy Airports.

### Tools and Technologies:

This project utilizes a variety of tools and technologies on the Google Cloud Platform for processing and analyzing Uber trip data:

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for scripting and data manipulation.
- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS):** Used for storing raw data as well as processed data.
- **Google Compute Engine:** Provides scalable compute instances to run Python scripts and handle data processing tasks.
- **Google BigQuery:** Serves as the analytics data warehouse, where all data querying and aggregation tasks are performed.
- **Mage:** A modern data pipeline tool utilized for efficient ETL processes, integrating seamlessly with other GCP services.
- **Looker Studio:** Used for creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards to display analytical insights derived from the data.

### Project Execution Flow
The Uber Data Analysis project follows a structured data pipeline designed to handle large volumes of taxi trip data efficiently:

- **Data Acquisition and Staging:**

  - **Retrieve Data:** Automatically fetch trip data files from the TLC Trip Record Data source and store them in Google Cloud Storage.
  - **Load Data:** Import these data files into staging tables in BigQuery for preliminary processing.

- **Data Analysis**

  - **BigQuery:** Use BigQuery to perform complex SQL queries that extract insights from the processed data. This analysis leverages BigQueryâ€™s powerful data warehousing capabilities to uncover trends, patterns, and statistical information that inform strategic decisions. Here are some of the key analyses conducted:

  1. **Average Fare Amount Based on Vendor:** This query calculates the average fare amount collected from each vendor.
   
  2. **Average Fare Amount by Hour of the Day:** Analyzes fare amounts to determine how they vary by different hours of the day, providing insights into peak fare times.
   
  3. **Average Tip Amount by Payment Type:** This query evaluates how the average tip amount varies depending on the payment method used.
   
  4. **Total Fare Amount Based on Vendor:** Summarizes the total fare amount collected by each vendor, highlighting the revenue impact of each.
   
  5. **Total Number of Trips by Passenger Count:** This query examines the distribution of trips based on the number of passengers, which can help in understanding passenger behavior and preferences.

  - **Visualization with Looker Studio**
    - **Looker Studio:** Utilized Looker Studio to create an interactive dashboard that presents comprehensive analytics from the Uber trip data. This visualization includes several components that highlight key aspects of the data:

    - **Filters:** Users can filter the data based on Vendor ID, Payment Type, Trip Distance, and Rate Code Name, allowing for customized views of the dataset.
    
    - **Summary Section:** Provides a quick snapshot of total earnings, number of trips, average trip distance, and average fare amounts.
    
    - **Map Visualization:** Displays the geographical distribution of trips, with color coding to differentiate between various rate codes such as Negotiated fare, Standard rate, JFK, Nassau or Westchester, and Group ride. This helps in visualizing high traffic areas and analyzing geographical trends.
    
    - **Charts Section:** Includes bar charts that show:
      - **Average Amount by Rate Code:** Compares the average fare amounts across different rate types.
      - **Average Amount by Payment Type:** Breaks down average fares by payment methods like Credit Card, Cash, No Charge, and Dispute, offering insights into payment preferences and patterns.
